#Remove Google Redirect in Google Results

An add-on to remove the Google redirect from Google search results, so that right-click copy link location doesn't result in a super-ugly URL.

This plugin is current available for installation at the [Firefox Add-On website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-google-redirect-in-goog/).
